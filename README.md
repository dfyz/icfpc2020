## Alphabet

64 different numbers on a 8x8 grid (kudos to @fnz for decoding them). Could this be an encoding table for string messages?

## Tic-tac-toe

The bottom 3x3 square is a tic-tac-toe game field: initially all squares are gray; we go first and paint one square white, the AI then paints one square black. It looks like the AI is smart enough that the best we can hope for is a draw (of course we can lose, too, and the picture shows how this can happen).

The top 3x3 square is a counter of some sort. It changes its value only after a draw, but I can't figure out what exactly it represents.

## Pulsar map

I have no idea what this is about, but if you squint hard enough it somewhat looks like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque#Sun_and_galactic_landmarks), hence the codename.

## Game rules

A 2x5 table filled with numbers. The label for the first row is `C + H + V + D`, the second row label is `R` (see the description of the tutorials for more details). The column labels might be the distance to the space station (or something else entirely I'm not really sure).
