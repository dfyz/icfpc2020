# Galaxy Explained

## Alphabet

64 different numbers on a 8x8 grid (kudos to @fnz for decoding them). Could this be an encoding table for string messages?

## Tic-tac-toe

The bottom 3x3 square is a tic-tac-toe game field: initially all squares are gray; we go first and paint one square white, the AI then paints one square black. It looks like the AI is smart enough that the best we can hope for is a draw (of course we can lose, too, and the picture shows how this can happen).

The top 3x3 square is a counter of some sort. It changes its value only after a draw, but I can't figure out what exactly it represents.

## Pulsar map

I have no idea what this is about, but if you squint hard enough it somewhat looks like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_plaque#Sun_and_galactic_landmarks), hence the codename.

## Game rules

A 2x5 table filled with numbers. The label for the first row is `C + H + V + D`, the second row label is `R` (see the description of the tutorials for more details). The column labels might be the distance to the space station (or something else entirely, I'm not really sure).

## Tutorial levels from the Battleground

We basically fly a small ship and dock to space stations. You are presented with a cockpit when you click on the ship.

Cockpit buttons control the ship:
  * `T`: the **t**hrust control panel. Choose one of 8 possible directions to engage the thruster and accelerate.
  * `R`: **р**уль for docking (I should have used `D` for this one, but oh well). Pressing this activates docking on your next turn (you'd better be near a space station).

Cockpit counters show confusing numbers:
  * `A`: always zero in all tutorial levels we have unlocked. Purpose unclear.
  * `B`: Purpose unclear.
  * `C`: the **c**heckerboard counter (see the icon). Has something to do with thruster.
  * `H`: the **h**orizontal counter. Ditto.
  * `V`: the **v**ertical counter. Ditto.
  * `D`: the **d**ot in a square counter. Ditto.
